01:38
starting off with an ovation launch key

mini MK 3 developed primarily for
01:44
Ableton uses and newly updated this
01:46
pocket powerhouse is just brimming with
01:48
features many of which were missing from
01:50
the previous version including finally

launch key mean MK 3 is an exclusive to
02:08
Ableton as
02:09
plays perfectly nicely with other doors
02:11
- but if you're a live user
02:13
it's undoubtedly represents the best
02:15
solution at this price point the next 25
02:18
key MIDI keyboard that we're going to be
02:19
looking at is the Akai MPK mini mk2 as
02:23
far as MIDI keyboards go the Akai MPK
02:26
mini mk2 is an oldie but a goodie still
02:29
hanging in there at the top of the sale
02:30
charts after five years and for good
02:32
reason the kiya pitch the mpk mini mk2
02:35
perfectly between breadth of features
02:37
portability build quality and
02:39
affordability standout features include
02:42
the four-way joystick for pitch Bend and
02:44
modulation the Bolton appreciates and
02:46
note repeat functions generous provision
02:48
of knobs and fantastic feeling in PC

02:53
lightweight MIDI controller to slip into
02:55
your laptop back when on the move or for
02:58
controlling software instruments and
02:59
plugins in a studio setting the mpk mini
03:02
mk2 wraps everything up in an affordable
03:04
practical package and the final midi
03:07
keyboard that we're going to be looking
03:08
at in terms of 25k MIDI keyboard is the
03:11
etherium mini lab mk2
03:12
if you're looking for a cost-effective
03:14
entry into arterials analog lab suite of
03:17
vintage analog synth emulations look no
03:20
further than the mini lab mk2 mini
03:22
controller like all arteria gear the
03:24
mini lab mk2 is a good-looking well
03:26
built and functional medic controller
03:28
whether 16 encoders providing plenty of
03:31
scope for tweaking the 500 analog lab
03:33
virtual vintage synth presets in ships
03:35
with the encoders automatically assigned
03:37
to the most relevant parameters for each
03:39
sound weighing in at only 1.5 kilograms
03:42
its compact footprint means that it
03:44
passes the laptop bag test easily and
03:47
while equally at home at the centerpiece
03:49
of your studio
03:50
it's obviously solidly built enough to
03:52
withstand being heptad about from place
03:54
to place
03:54
moving on to 49 key MIDI keyboards I'm
03:57
looking at people that have a more
03:59
settled home studio setup where you have
04:01
a decent amount of space on your desk
04:03
where you can actually take a 40 90
04:05
minute keyboard have fun with it have
04:07
decent keys for the first time because
04:09
like I said 25 key MIDI keyboards don't
04:11
have decent keys in terms of size where
04:13
49 key MIDI keyboards is the first step
04:15
to that you still get all the drum pad
04:18
you need to be productive and creative
04:19
but you aren't as portable unfortunate
04:22
me you are portable enough to put it in
04:24
your car and things like that but in
04:26
terms of being on the go with a backpack
04:27
or something like that
04:28
49 keys is not the way to go but if you
04:31
are more settled in your home studio
04:32
like I said earlier 49 keys are probably
04:35
the best MIDI keyboard size to go for
04:37
the top 349 mini keyboards that I've
04:39
picked for this list is M audios oxygen
04:41
49 Novation launch key USB 49 and
04:45
arteria key lab essentials 49 starting
04:48
us off with M audios oxygen 49 USB now
04:53
in the fourth iteration M audios oxygen
04:55
MIDI controllers have always been
04:56
popular all three versions actually the
04:59
25:49 and 61 key versions offering a
05:02
great compromise between features key
05:04
range and price compared to the key
05:06
station 61 with a 49 you may be losing
05:09
an octave but you're gaining much more
05:11
in terms of functionality if hardware
05:14
controls are more important to you than
05:15
an expansive range of keys the oxygen 49
05:18
makes 8 great compromise with an
05:20
impressive array of knobs buttons and
05:22
sliders dedicated door transport
05:24
controls and 8 premium filled drum pads
05:26
this compact yet powerful MIDI

three list is a serious collab essential

07:23
soft way on any platform moving on to 61
07:27
key MIDI keyboards these many keyboards
07:29
are more for people that are really
07:31
settled in their home studio setup I
07:33
don't even have a 61 key MIDI keyboard
07:35
and I'm really settled with a 49
07:36
committee keyboard but if you're someone
07:38
that's plays piano and you really like
07:41
into having a lot more keys and things
07:42
like that
07:43
61 Keys is the way to go it's not a very
07:46
popular MIDI keyboard size out there to
07:48
be honest but it's really nice for
07:50
people that like playing piano and need
07:51
more keys to be creative and the first
07:54
MIDI keyboard that I've picked for the
07:55
top 3 bass 61 committee keyboards out
07:58
they in 2020 is the Novation launch key
08:00
USB 61 mk2
08:03
this latest generation of launch keys
08:05
innovations most focus midi keyboard
08:07
controller for Ableton Live it's the
08:09
quickest and easiest way to produce and
08:11
perform electronic music because it's
08:13
designed specifically for the purpose
08:14
just plug in via USB and the keys faders
08:17
knobs and pads immediately give you
08:19
hands-on control of your grid
08:21
instruments effects and the mixer of
08:23
course if you don't use Ableton it will
08:26
map to other major music software's to
08:28
using in control the next 61-key midi
08:31
keyboard that i've picked for the top
08:32
three list is the alesis v 61 the Lisa's
08:36
V 61 is a powerful intuitive MIDI
08:38
controller that lets you take command of
08:40
your computers music software without
08:42
giving up your capacity for dynamic
08:44
performances with 61 full-sized
08:46
velocity-sensitive keys
08:48
octave up-down buttons you can expand
08:50
the keyboard to the full melodic range
08:52
and play bass lines chords and melodies
08:54
and the final midi keyboard that 61 keys
08:57
that i've picked for this top three list
08:59
that is just fantastic is the Native
09:02
Instruments Komplete Kontrol s61 mk2 the
09:05
complete control a 61 mk2 is a smart
09:08
midi keyboard controller that offers
09:10
pre-mapped control of a nice complete
09:12
instruments and any third-party plugins
09:14
that support the in case standard in
09:16
comparison to its predecessor the
09:18
complete control mk2 also adds two
09:20
high-resolution color screens along with
09:23
17 additional function buttons is a
09:25
tighter door machine integration -
09:27
making it possible to mix navigate and
09:30
edit projects from the hard way you can
09:32
do so much more from the device itself
09:33
with better visual feedback and much
09:36
deeper levels of integration front and
09:37
center of its workflow if you already
09:40
web - the complete software package
09:42
nothing will help you work with it as
09:44
musically as complete control mk2
09:46
and finally moving on to 88-key MIDI
09:49
keyboards if you're someone that's
09:51
looking to buy an 8080 MIDI keyboard
09:53
please be a piano player otherwise you
09:55
are wasting your time and your money
09:57
because it's a beat maker you only
09:59
really need twenty-five keys if you have
10:01
a 49 committee keyboard you're pretty
10:03
much around in the middle getting
10:04
everything you need same with the 61 key
10:06
MIDI keyboard but that's already a
10:08
little bit of an overkill and an 88 key
10:10
MIDI keyboard for someone that doesn't
10:11
play piano it just produces and makes
10:13
music it's a little bit of an overkill
10:15
but if you do want it go for it and if
10:18
you are a piano player
10:19
it's definitely the keyboard size you
10:21
should be looking at but anyway the
10:23
first 88-key MIDI keyboard that I've
10:25
picked for my top three list is the
10:27
nectar impact alex 88 plus MIDI keyboard
10:31
today's buyers of keyboard controllers
10:33
are spoiled for choice but if you're
10:35
looking for a full size 88 note MIDI
10:37
controller set choices are more limited
10:39
one great option is nectars impact Alex
10:42
88 + which combines an 88 key semi
10:45
weighted USB powered keyboard with
10:47
extensive duel control via nine sliders
10:49
nine buttons eight knobs eight pads and
10:52
transport controls despite the number of
10:55
features the Alex 88 plus is reasonably
10:57
compact and light enough to be portable
10:59
what's more the keys feel good and
11:02
mechanical noise is quite low the Alex
11:04
88 plus one suits everyone and some 88
11:07
key users will be after a full weighted
11:09
hammer action but at this price it's a
11:11
bargain and well worth testing the next
11:14
88 key MIDI keyboard that I've picked
11:15
for this list is the interior key lab
11:17
essential 88 creating music in a digital
11:20
world can be difficult so many options
11:22
so many new things to learn but the key
11:25
lab essential lets you focus on what's
11:27
important eight pads nine rotaries nine
11:30
faders and an expressive keyboard but so
11:32
so much more music is at the heart of
11:35
this controller every aspect of key lab
11:37
essential has been carefully chosen to
11:39
give you the best possible experience
11:41
when creating and performing key lab
11:44
essential makes navigating inside your
11:45
recording software a breeze thanks to
11:47
the dedicated door command center and
11:49
makes browsing your presets and exciting
11:52
and inspiring experience spend less time
11:54
with a keyboard and mouse and more time
11:56
creating and performing and just playing
11:59
and finally I've left the base for lost
12:02
the best 88-key MIDI keyboard out there
12:05
for any home studio setup any home
12:06
stereo producer anybody in general
12:09
pretty much the holy grail of MIDI
12:11
keyboards is Native Instruments Komplete
12:13
Kontrol SAT 8 mk2 the SAT 8 MK 2 is
12:18
impressive both technologically and
12:20
physically solidly built and elegant in
12:23
appearance with a keyboard that is a
12:25
pleasure to play while focusing one's
12:28
attention on the SL 8 rather than the
12:30
mouse and screen it's a very different
12:31
way of working that may not appeal to
12:33
everyone there are many advantages to
12:35
this approach not least of which is
12:37
speedy navigation though a potential
12:40
labyrinth of sounds and instant tweak
12:42
ability once you get there inevitably
12:44
you will have to address the computer
12:46
and Mouse at times particularly when
12:48
dealing with anything not encased
12:50
compatible but it's worth checking out
12:52
your instrument armory regular for
12:54
updates as more and more products are
12:56
entering the inka is --fold at the end
12:58
of the day this is just a fantastic MIDI
13:00
keyboard and in my opinion the best of
13:03
the best that you could get right now so
13:06
that's the end of this first video of my
13:08

novation lauchkey mini mk3, perfect for ableton user, not good for others
arturia minilab, better key bed, more versatile, comes with good sound lib
akai mpk mini, best compatiable, knobs, pads, arpeggiator,



sonic TV hello welcome to another Sonic
00:04
lab today we're looking at the new Akai
00:07
Max 49 this is a new controller keyboard
00:10
from acai that's got something a bit
00:11
different about it and what that is is
00:13
as well as all the usual suspects pads
00:16
and faders and buttons of what have you
00:18
it's got CV and gate output so it will
00:21
actually drive your analog equipment
00:23
let's take a look at the features so
00:25
here is the unit it's beautiful and bold
00:27
red it's actually a very nicely sort of
00:29
lustrous almost sports car shiny finish
00:32
we've got the 49 key version here this
00:35
keyboard is a sort of fairly solid synth
00:37
action feels quite nice actually it's
00:40
got a sort of chunky feel to it it's got
00:42
aftertouch as well just standard
00:44
aftertouch it's quite heavy it's got a
00:46
sort of metal base and starting over
00:48
here we've got pitch and mod wheels
00:50
which was like rubberized then I've got
00:53
various different mode switches for the
00:54
arpeggiator and the sequencer more on
00:57
that later then we have 12 backlit MPC
01:00
style pads and these also double up as
01:03
mode switches for the secrets are on
01:04
page 8 ER these are also pressure
01:07
sensitive though they don't send per pad
01:09
controller data they either send poly
01:12
aftertouch or regular after touch and
01:14
there are four banks of these which give
01:16
you a total of 48 possible pads then
01:20
we've got transport control octave up
01:22
and down edit mode buttons little four
01:25
row LCD display rotary encoder with a
01:30
push and then cursor controls different
01:33
modes for sequencer and then banks of
01:36
faders these faders are quite
01:37
interesting because what they are is
01:39
backlit with little LEDs so you can see
01:43
the value and you've got four banks of
01:45
them so switching between banks you
01:47
still know where you are and that's
01:49
actually quite a neat little touch
01:51
actually then we've got these eight
01:54
select buttons here as well which can be
01:56
configured in different ways also if you
01:58
press this button it becomes the time
02:00
division for the sequencer in the
02:01
arpeggiator what's also cool is this has
02:05
Mackie control and fury built in so we
02:09
can switch and use it as effectively a
02:12
secret to controller for
02:13
banks of faders and what-have-you but
02:15
more on that later so looking away in
02:16
the back you get to see the lovely red
02:18
finishes entirety nice big logo right
02:21
there this is the first connections
02:23
these are the keyboard CV and gate this
02:25
is for driving your analog kit see the
02:28
output would typically drive the pitch
02:29
of an oscillator so that would be for
02:31
the pitch so they key will be mapped to
02:33
one volt per octave so your gear will
02:35
need to talk one volt per octave so
02:38
that's most modern analog equipment some
02:40
of the more obscure stuff like they call
02:42
em s and some of the Moog things might
02:44
not work with it then gate at which you
02:46
would typically use to trigger the
02:47
envelope so envelope and pitch it would
02:50
be nice to perhaps see another couple of
02:51
CV so we could maybe Matt one of the
02:53
faders or to the faders to another
02:55
control or two here but suddenly we
02:57
can't instantly we can't access this as
02:59
a separate MIDI port so as well as the
03:02
MIDI in and the out we've got we could
03:05
send that to external gear and then have
03:07
this driving some analog gear and
03:08
address them separately from your door
03:10
or from the keyboard we've also got foot
03:13
switch pedals inputs foot switch one and
03:15
two sustain an expression as I say MIDI
03:18
in and out here then a USB port for
03:20
connecting to the computer that will
03:22
drive the MIDI over it and also allow
03:23
you to hook up the software editor there
03:26
is a six volt DC power supply which you
03:29
don't need because you can power over
03:30
USB and that concludes the tour whereas
03:35
I've got this hooked up to my analog
03:36
rack what I have here is my dope for a
03:39
1-1 five mini synthesizer voice and a
03:41
couple of Pittsburgh modular so this is
03:43
what I'm going to do is just will listen
03:44
to
03:45
[Music]
03:49
listen to the notes
03:52
[Music]
03:57
I like the way that it just works and it
04:00
sounds like the scaling is really
04:02
spot-on
04:02
if we need to we can actually affect the
04:05
scaling and the intonation there's a
04:07
couple of parameters here which allow
04:08
you to affect the scaling but there's
04:10
also as well as being able to play from
04:13
the keyboard and the sequencer and the
04:16
arpeggiator we can switch it to be from
04:19
the pads as well means we can trigger
04:23
some quite interesting things if this
04:25
hit note repeat and change the beat
04:28
divisions
04:29
[Music]
04:34
we do some pretty interesting stuff with
04:36
that as well as this you can also change
04:39
the output to be any of the USB MIDI
04:41
Channel ports as well so that means you
04:43
can route your sequencer tracks directly
04:47
through to the CV as well as other
04:50
external MIDI gear that you might have
04:52
running out of their MIDI output on this
04:53
so let's talk about the MIDI side of it
04:55
the midi keyboard is a single channel
04:58
only you cannot split
05:00
you cannot layer you can change them in
05:02
a channel of the keyboard and you can
05:04
switch the aftertouch on or off and
05:06
change velocity curves coming up to the
05:08
front panel the pads each of the parts
05:11
can be of note type program change or
05:14
Bank change and you can have a different
05:16
MIDI channel for each of the 48 pads
05:19
coming off to the faders faders can be
05:22
various different protocols they can be
05:24
MIDI control after touch increment
05:27
decrement Mackie control Jiri
05:30
and that's basically it but again each
05:34
of those can have a separate MIDI
05:35
channel so you can mix it up and mash it
05:37
up quite nicely so we did mention Mackie
05:40
and Huey control and indeed you can set
05:42
this up to control your door in various
05:46
modes we'll have a quick look at that
05:47
now so I'm just working in logic here
05:49
I've set up a Mackie control and added
05:52
the the control ports our Mackie output
05:55
and Mackie input these at ports are
05:58
actually available as a specific port on
06:00
the Mac's 49 now if I close this down
06:02
all the faders are set to the specific
06:05
values I'll just go up here you can see
06:08
that if I move this fader it's
06:10
corresponds etc etc so I press play
06:14
do that I can rewind and fast-forward as
06:17
I would expect and these different banks
06:21
of faders do different things if I open
06:23
the mixer window we can obviously see
06:25
Bank one is volume and that the cool
06:29
thing is is obviously if I change the
06:30
value of the fader updates on the actual
06:34
unit these buttons are mute buttons in
06:38
logic they mute the actual channels
06:42
rather than the door tracks which is a
06:44
sort of foible of the logic way of doing
06:46
things next Bank is pan control and solo
06:52
so like solo these and actually if I go
06:54
back it shows me the status which is
06:56
kind of cool take that out here next one
07:00
is record arm and then finally take that
07:05
record on and finally we've got track
07:06
select you can see that a little bit
07:08
better just by the way this works now
07:11
obviously with the banking you probably
07:14
want to see how that works if I scroll
07:15
down to my next bank of faders you can
07:19
see that the next day I have different
07:21
volumes different volume settings now I
07:24
have set up another program because it
07:26
is possible to edit the function of
07:28
these buttons and what I did is I set
07:29
these two buttons to be up-and-down
07:31
track because I can go in and edit them
07:33
and I can have they can have maki values
07:36
they can be up/down fast forward rewind
07:38
so i can modify it to a certain degree
07:40
but the Maki and the QE functionality is
07:43
limited purely to these buttons here
07:45
there's no accessing any of the other
07:47
ones and that obviously the transport
07:48
have been great if we could have had the
07:50
pads to be working as Maki control for
07:52
things like you know opening and closing
07:53
windows saving you know markers all the
07:55
other functions that we've got there but
07:57
we're just limited to the transport
07:59
control the 8 faders and the 8 buttons
08:01
so as well as these control modes
08:03
there's something called Akai Connect
08:05
which essentially is very similar in
08:07
concept to the Novation automap and what
08:10
it does is allows you to wrap certain
08:13
plugins or all of your VST plugins in
08:16
these kind of Akai Connect software I'll
08:19
show you what that does so Akai Connect
08:21
is running here so like a little server
08:23
it has to be running all the time this
08:24
is the list of the plugins that I've
08:25
chosen to wrap I've got
08:27
audio damage combat and a couple of the
08:30
Focusrite compressors and eq's and the
08:33
scarlet stuff now unfortunately it is
08:36
only VST so I'm going to have to quit
08:39
logic because that only runs Audio Units
08:40
and Load something which has VST and
08:43
I've got Reaper so let's do that now so
08:46
I'm set up in Reaper here I've got my
08:49
run factors to stand a drug that I'm
08:51
going to add some compression to it so
08:53
go to my effects I'm looking for one of
08:56
the a/c wrapped this is my scarlet
08:58
compressor I'm gonna add that it's got
09:00
AC in brackets which means it has been
09:03
wrapped for auto-connect
09:04
here we go now I come to my keyboard and
09:08
I've got to go in to connect mode which
09:11
is program 33 so now you see when I move
09:16
I've got the bypass I've got the input
09:19
gain let's try one of the big an old
09:20
threshold ratio that's all fine but I'd
09:23
actually like to remap that so I can go
09:25
to my server I can select the editor
09:28
here and I can remap these controls so
09:33
I'm gonna have that button to be enable
09:35
I'm gonna have this fader to be input
09:37
gain say threshold it gives me the list
09:40
of all of the ratio and output gain and
09:44
I can save that map now if I come back
09:48
to my sequencer and give you a keyboard
09:52
view I now have this button is bypass
09:58
threshold ratio but if I want to then go
10:02
back into play I've gotta go back to my
10:04
Mackie control mode get it playing then
10:08
go back to the number 33 and yeah it's
10:15
sort of there we go Lucy is a bit clunky
10:18
it's not kind of the perfect connection
10:20
you can't auto sense that the the
10:23
plugins are live and it will just
10:25
automatically do it so it's not the most
10:27
elegant and I did find that I was having
10:29
some problems when I was switching
10:31
between plugins it was a little bit for
10:33
next to you it doesn't feel like it's
10:34
quite as highly developed as say the the
10:38
Novation system but you know it's there
10:40
and it's available so it's a couple more
10:43
features we should look at we've got the
10:44
arpeggiator and the sequencer so we're
10:46
just going to arpeggiator mode switch
10:49
the arpeggiator on and then press a note
10:53
where I press and hold the arc mode I
10:55
can flip between all the different modes
10:57
I got up/down inclusive exclusive octave
11:01
range across the top up to three octaves
11:03
random note double cord mode which isn't
11:07
going to work on a money so mono synth
11:08
and all of those kind of things that are
11:10
very easy to switch if I switch it into
11:13
latch mode
11:15
I get a few more octaves going
11:18
then I can go our beat divisions by
11:20
pressing this button for a note quarter
11:23
notes triplets
11:24
eights up to sixteen thirty-two triplets
11:28
I've got across the master tempo going
11:31
into pattern mode and hitting edit means
11:34
that we've got a pattern mode of
11:37
arpeggiator so we can change the number
11:39
of beats that that pattern has up to
11:42
sixteen and we can also switch them on
11:46
switch them on or off it's a bit fiddly
11:49
but it means you can get sort of
11:50
rhythmic effects as well additionally
11:52
we've got a sequencer mode which gives
11:55
us access to up to four patterns per
11:58
patch of up to thirty-two notes in
12:00
length so we just go into sequence
12:03
select mode if I press and hold I can
12:05
choose from any one of four sequence
12:07
patterns these are stored in each of the
12:10
internal memories so you can have a
12:12
number of them they chained now each of
12:13
these can be up to 32 steps in length so
12:18
if we go back in we'll select
12:23
fine without secrets note mode
12:26
I just edit dots
12:31
eight steps I can change the number of
12:33
steps if we look to bring and Diane it
12:34
switches to more often grid and this
12:37
represents I switch the steps each of
12:42
the steps on or off
12:47
and I've also got controller mode
12:50
summative controller which I've said to
12:51
me whatever CC member I want and then
12:54
just kind of have that go alongside it's
12:56
also possible to have key shift on for
12:59
the sequencer so I can press them I can
13:02
play it then when I
13:03
[Music]
13:07
it transposes although I'm hearing
13:12
glitch in the beginning which I couldn't
13:14
seem to get rid of so you can use the
13:16
secrets of sort of like an arpeggiator
13:18
or as a sort of for patent sequence or
13:21
if you're triggering other kit but it is
13:23
monophonic and it's good for using with
13:26
the analog kit actually so the max 49
13:28
certainly is packed full of features and
13:31
it's a nicely built nice looking thing I
13:34
like the fact that pads what I really
13:36
like the touch faders I think it's a
13:38
great idea of something that works
13:40
really nicely the banking works
13:42
exceptionally well this is something you
13:43
couldn't do with traditional hardware
13:46
faders unless they were moving fringes
13:47
which of course would make the price
13:49
prohibitive speaking of the price we're
13:52
talking about 309 UK pounds other
13:54
currencies will scroll below so it's
13:56
quite an expensive unit but it does do
13:58
quite a lot
13:59
I think perhaps that part of what it
14:01
does is not quite as well-developed as
14:04
some of the competition I'm thinking
14:05
really the kind of plug-in integration
14:08
just doesn't feel quite as solid as I'd
14:12
like it to and the Huey and Mackie
14:14
emulation is great it would have been
14:16
really nice like I say to have more
14:18
controls available to do that with and
14:20
using the pads would be great but that's
14:22
something that could be addressed in a
14:23
future software upgrade in fact that's
14:25
entirely possible
14:25
and also we've got analog control which
14:28
is a great feature really in a pre
14:30
keyboard that's normally with just a
14:32
destined for MIDI although like I said
14:34
before it would be great to have a
14:36
couple of extra channels for CV with all
14:37
this control we've got something that's
14:39
just dying to be controlled but we can
14:41
only do gate and CV so never mind on the
14:45
whole though I think what we've got is
14:47
MPC pads quite a nice feeling synth
14:50
keyboard the the Huey and the Mackie
14:52
control it's a nice package if a little
14:55
bit expensive
