and the arterian mini lab indicates you
01:38
starting off with an ovation launch key
01:41
mini MK 3 developed primarily for
01:44
Ableton uses and newly updated this
01:46
pocket powerhouse is just brimming with
01:48
features many of which were missing from
01:50
the previous version including finally
01:53
pitch Bend and modulation touch strips
01:55
are hardware money out on a TRS Jack an
01:57
incredibly flexible and versatile

02:00
a cord memory feature and a great deal
02:03
sweetening software bundle of course the
02:06
launch key mean MK 3 is an exclusive to
02:08
Ableton as
02:09
plays perfectly nicely with other doors
02:11
- but if you're a live user
02:13
it's undoubtedly represents the best
02:15
solution at this price point the next 25
02:18
key MIDI keyboard that we're going to be
02:19
looking at is the Akai MPK mini mk2 as
02:23
far as MIDI keyboards go the Akai MPK
02:26
mini mk2 is an oldie but a goodie still
02:29
hanging in there at the top of the sale
02:30
charts after five years and for good
02:32
reason the kiya pitch the mpk mini mk2
02:35
perfectly between breadth of features
02:37
portability build quality and
02:39
affordability standout features include
02:42
the four-way joystick for pitch Bend and
02:44
modulation the Bolton appreciates and
02:46
note repeat functions generous provision
02:48
of knobs and fantastic feeling in PC
02:50
style pads equally at home as a small
02:53
lightweight MIDI controller to slip into
02:55
your laptop back when on the move or for
02:58
controlling software instruments and
02:59
plugins in a studio setting the mpk mini
03:02
mk2 wraps everything up in an affordable
03:04
practical package and the final midi
03:07
keyboard that we're going to be looking
03:08
at in terms of 25k MIDI keyboard is the
03:11
etherium mini lab mk2
03:12
if you're looking for a cost-effective
03:14
entry into arterials analog lab suite of
03:17
vintage analog synth emulations look no
03:20
further than the mini lab mk2 mini
03:22
controller like all arteria gear the
03:24
mini lab mk2 is a good-looking well
03:26
built and functional medic controller
03:28
whether 16 encoders providing plenty of
03:31
scope for tweaking the 500 analog lab
03:33
virtual vintage synth presets in ships
03:35
with the encoders automatically assigned
03:37
to the most relevant parameters for each
03:39
sound weighing in at only 1.5 kilograms
03:42
its compact footprint means that it
03:44
passes the laptop bag test easily and
03:47
while equally at home at the centerpiece
03:49
of your studio
03:50
it's obviously solidly built enough to
03:52
withstand being heptad about from place
03:54
to place
03:54
moving on to 49 key MIDI keyboards I'm
03:57
looking at people that have a more
03:59
settled home studio setup where you have
04:01
a decent amount of space on your desk
04:03
where you can actually take a 40 90
04:05
minute keyboard have fun with it have
04:07
decent keys for the first time because
04:09
like I said 25 key MIDI keyboards don't
04:11
have decent keys in terms of size where
04:13
49 key MIDI keyboards is the first step
04:15
to that you still get all the drum pad
04:18
you need to be productive and creative
04:19
but you aren't as portable unfortunate
04:22
me you are portable enough to put it in
04:24
your car and things like that but in
04:26
terms of being on the go with a backpack
04:27
or something like that
04:28
49 keys is not the way to go but if you
04:31
are more settled in your home studio
04:32
like I said earlier 49 keys are probably
04:35
the best MIDI keyboard size to go for
04:37
the top 349 mini keyboards that I've
04:39
picked for this list is M audios oxygen
04:41
49 Novation launch key USB 49 and
04:45
arteria key lab essentials 49 starting
04:48
us off with M audios oxygen 49 USB now
04:53
in the fourth iteration M audios oxygen
04:55
MIDI controllers have always been
04:56
popular all three versions actually the
04:59
25:49 and 61 key versions offering a
05:02
great compromise between features key
05:04
range and price compared to the key
05:06
station 61 with a 49 you may be losing
05:09
an octave but you're gaining much more
05:11
in terms of functionality if hardware
05:14
controls are more important to you than
05:15
an expansive range of keys the oxygen 49
05:18
makes 8 great compromise with an
05:20
impressive array of knobs buttons and
05:22
sliders dedicated door transport
05:24
controls and 8 premium filled drum pads

soft way on any platform moving on to 61
07:27
key MIDI keyboards these many keyboards
07:29
are more for people that are really
07:31
settled in their home studio setup I
07:33
don't even have a 61 key MIDI keyboard
07:35
and I'm really settled with a 49
07:36
committee keyboard but if you're someone
07:38
that's plays piano and you really like
07:41
into having a lot more keys and things
07:42
like that
07:43
61 Keys is the way to go it's not a very
07:46
popular MIDI keyboard size out there to
07:48
be honest but it's really nice for
07:50
people that like playing piano and need
07:51
more keys to be creative and the first
07:54
MIDI keyboard that I've picked for the
07:55
top 3 bass 61 committee keyboards out
07:58
they in 2020 is the Novation launch key
08:00
USB 61 mk2
08:03
this latest generation of launch keys
08:05
innovations most focus midi keyboard
08:07
controller for Ableton Live it's the
08:09
quickest and easiest way to produce and
08:11
perform electronic music because it's
08:13
designed specifically for the purpose
08:14
just plug in via USB and the keys faders
08:17
knobs and pads immediately give you
08:19
hands-on control of your grid
08:21
instruments effects and the mixer of
08:23
course if you don't use Ableton it will
08:26
map to other major music software's to
08:28
using in control the next 61-key midi
08:31
keyboard that i've picked for the top
08:32
three list is the alesis v 61 the Lisa's
08:36
V 61 is a powerful intuitive MIDI
08:38
controller that lets you take command of
08:40
your computers music software without
08:42
giving up your capacity for dynamic
08:44
performances with 61 full-sized
08:46
velocity-sensitive keys
08:48
octave up-down buttons you can expand
08:50
the keyboard to the full melodic range
08:52
and play bass lines chords and melodies
08:54
and the final midi keyboard that 61 keys
08:57
that i've picked for this top three list
08:59
that is just fantastic is the Native
09:02
Instruments Komplete Kontrol s61 mk2 the
09:05
complete control a 61 mk2 is a smart
09:08
midi keyboard controller that offers
09:10
pre-mapped control of a nice complete
09:12
instruments and any third-party plugins
09:14
that support the in case standard in
09:16
comparison to its predecessor the
09:18
complete control mk2 also adds two
09:20
high-resolution color screens along with
09:23
17 additional function buttons is a
09:25
tighter door machine integration -
09:27
making it possible to mix navigate and
09:30
edit projects from the hard way you can
09:32
do so much more from the device itself
09:33
with better visual feedback and much
09:36
deeper levels of integration front and
09:37
center of its workflow if you already
09:40
web - the complete software package
09:42
nothing will help you work with it as
09:44
musically as complete control mk2
09:46
and finally moving on to 88-key MIDI
09:49
keyboards if you're someone that's
09:51
looking to buy an 8080 MIDI keyboard
09:53
please be a piano player otherwise you
09:55
are wasting your time and your money
09:57
because it's a beat maker you only
09:59
really need twenty-five keys if you have
10:01
a 49 committee keyboard you're pretty
10:03
much around in the middle getting
10:04
everything you need same with the 61 key
10:06
MIDI keyboard but that's already a
10:08
little bit of an overkill and an 88 key
10:10
MIDI keyboard for someone that doesn't
10:11
play piano it just produces and makes
10:13
music it's a little bit of an overkill
10:15
but if you do want it go for it and if
10:18
you are a piano player
10:19
it's definitely the keyboard size you
10:21
should be looking at but anyway the
10:23
first 88-key MIDI keyboard that I've
10:25
picked for my top three list is the
10:27
nectar impact alex 88 plus MIDI keyboard
10:31
today's buyers of keyboard controllers
10:33
are spoiled for choice but if you're
10:35
looking for a full size 88 note MIDI
10:37
controller set choices are more limited
10:39
one great option is nectars impact Alex
10:42
88 + which combines an 88 key semi
10:45
weighted USB powered keyboard with
10:47
extensive duel control via nine sliders
10:49
nine buttons eight knobs eight pads and
10:52
transport controls despite the number of
10:55
features the Alex 88 plus is reasonably
10:57
compact and light enough to be portable
10:59
what's more the keys feel good and
11:02
mechanical noise is quite low the Alex
11:04
88 plus one suits everyone and some 88
11:07
key users will be after a full weighted
11:09
hammer action but at this price it's a
11:11
bargain and well worth testing the next
11:14
88 key MIDI keyboard that I've picked
11:15
for this list is the interior key lab
11:17
essential 88 creating music in a digital
11:20
world can be difficult so many options
11:22
so many new things to learn but the key
11:25
lab essential lets you focus on what's
11:27
important eight pads nine rotaries nine
11:30
faders and an expressive keyboard but so
11:32
so much more music is at the heart of
11:35
this controller every aspect of key lab
11:37
essential has been carefully chosen to
11:39
give you the best possible experience
11:41
when creating and performing key lab
11:44
essential makes navigating inside your
11:45
recording software a breeze thanks to
11:47
the dedicated door command center and
11:49
makes browsing your presets and exciting
11:52
and inspiring experience spend less time
11:54
with a keyboard and mouse and more time
11:56
creating and performing and just playing
11:59
and finally I've left the base for lost
12:02
the best 88-key MIDI keyboard out there
12:05
for any home studio setup any home
12:06
stereo producer anybody in general
12:09
pretty much the holy grail of MIDI
12:11
keyboards is Native Instruments Komplete
12:13
Kontrol SAT 8 mk2 the SAT 8 MK 2 is
12:18
impressive both technologically and
12:20
physically solidly built and elegant in
12:23
appearance with a keyboard that is a
12:25
pleasure to play while focusing one's
12:28
attention on the SL 8 rather than the
12:30
mouse and screen it's a very different
12:31
way of working that may not appeal to
12:33
everyone there are many advantages to
12:35
this approach not least of which is
12:37
speedy navigation though a potential
12:40
labyrinth of sounds and instant tweak
12:42
ability once you get there inevitably
12:44
you will have to address the computer
12:46
and Mouse at times particularly when
12:48
dealing with anything not encased
12:50
compatible but it's worth checking out
12:52
your instrument armory regular for
12:54
updates as more and more products are
12:56
entering the inka is --fold at the end
12:58
of the day this is just a fantastic MIDI
13:00
keyboard and in my opinion the best of
13:03
the best that you could get right now so
13:06
that's the end of this first video of my
13:08
